This repo contains the code for a basic To Do App website made with just HTML, CSS, and JS. The HTML, CSS, and JS code can be found in the docs folder.

On this To Do App website, users can create and check off tasks which are added to a To Do List. This site also has the additional functionalities of being able to delete tasks and reorder them in the list using drag and drop.

The final site can be accessed here: https://eshika.github.io/todo-app-html/
